"Context: 
Top management is extremely happy about the average delivery time that we have achieved in Philippines (~21min). That being said, they are urging us to find ways to increase our current rider utilisation rate (UTR).

Present your vision on our strategy to increase UTR. It needs to be data-driven.
Make sure to explain which lever should be tackled first and how."

"Note : 
i) You can find on the right 5 levers for improving UTR  Remember, the UTR captures the number of orders that a rider can complete in one hour (orders/hours)
ii) Leverage the data in the excel sheet provided with this assignment. 
iii) Feel free to make any assumption for all the necessary information that you have not been given (e.g., order distribution along the week is homogeneous -same amount of orders every day of the week). You can also add any data deep-dive, graph or material to support your argument".
